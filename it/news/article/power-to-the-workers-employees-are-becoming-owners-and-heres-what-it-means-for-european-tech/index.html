              Nasira, the <span class="caps">CEO</span> and founder of
              a&nbsp;fast-growing mobility startup from Amsterdam, was over the
              moon when her company raised its first venture round. Finally
              they’d have the cash to build out their product and hire
              a&nbsp;team that could expand into new markets. But despite the
              stamp of approval from world-class investors, Nasira was
              struggling to lure top technical and leadership talent.
              Established corporates and big tech companies always seemed to
              outflank her on salaries and benefits.<br />
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
              Nasira soon realised, though, that she had something up her
              sleeve. The prospect that her company would eventually be acquired
              or go public at an impressive valuation – as an increasing number
              of European startups had done – meant equity in her business was
              a&nbsp;drawcard. It took some time for Nasira to get used to the
              idea of giving away even more of what she’d built from scratch:
              after all, she’d already given a&nbsp;big slice to investors. But
              when she saw how appealing it made her company to candidates – not
              to mention the motivation for her team once they joined – she came
              around. By adding more stock options to remuneration packages,
              Nasira managed to lure a&nbsp;Chief Product Officer away from
              Uber, followed by an experienced Chief Operating Officer out of
              Amazon.<br />
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
              We’ve seen a&nbsp;version of Nasira’s story play out across Europe
              time and time again. In Silicon Valley, employee ownership has
              long been recognised as a&nbsp;vital implement in the
              entrepreneur’s toolkit. Not only do stock options draw more people
              to start-ups, which are a&nbsp;powerful engine of economic growth,
              productivity and job creation. After a&nbsp;successful exit, these
              companies also create <span class="push-single"></span>​<span
                class="pull-single"
                >‘</span
              >graduates’ who frequently re-invest their wealth, seeding the
              ecosystem with fresh founders and angel investors to jump-start
              a&nbsp;flywheel of innovation and investment. In Europe, startups
              cumulatively employ <span class="numbers">2</span>&nbsp;million
              people and have <span class="numbers">100</span>,<span
                class="numbers"
                >000</span
              >
              open positions. When start-ups succeed, the economy as
              a&nbsp;whole does too, and stock options are a&nbsp;key ingredient
              in that success.<br />
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
              On this side of the Atlantic, however, people have generally been
              slower to recognise the profound impact of employee ownership.
              Typically the carve-out for employees in European and
              <span class="caps">UK</span> start-ups would flatline at
              <span class="numbers">10</span>%, with everyone’s existing shares
              being diluted with each new round of funding. Early joiners’
              willingness to take the gamble on a&nbsp;young company might still
              be recognised with a&nbsp;larger option allocation, but they could
              expect less than half of what their
              <span class="caps">US</span> peers would receive for equivalent
              stages of funding and seniority.<br />

              The good news is that all of this is changing. New research
              conducted by Index Ventures shows that, over the past five years,
              the <span class="caps">UK</span> and Europe have been closing the
              gap with the <span class="caps">US</span>. No longer is the share
              of employee ownership maxing out at
              <span class="numbers">10</span>%. Instead, it’s nearing the
              <span class="numbers">20</span>% mark as companies approach
              IPO-readiness, within striking distance of the
              <span class="caps">US</span> at around
              <span class="numbers">25</span>%. The biggest increases in stock
              option grants have been in more technical roles, and for
              experienced leaders across all functions. But in line with the
              recent explosion of

              What’s behind this dramatic change? Funding used to be the major
              bottleneck to company growth in Europe. But as investors have
              understood the opportunity in recent years, capital has flowed
              more freely. Today instead, it’s the best talent – the developers,
              the salespeople, the communication strategists – that are the
              hardest to come by, and the most fiercely fought for. Hence they
              can command more power in the market, and rightly expect
              a&nbsp;bigger portion of the financial upside from the companies
              they’re helping to build. Instead of relying on a&nbsp;salary,
              workers see their labour as an investment in the company, and are
              demanding that it be rewarded. They’re asking for, and getting
              access to, the greater returns available on capital, and as
              a&nbsp;result, equity is shifting from the pockets of investors
              into the hands of employees.

              Wider sociocultural trends are also supporting the growth of stock
              options in Europe. With many more high profile IPOs under our
              belt, joining a&nbsp;start-up is no longer seen as a&nbsp;crazy
              idea – it’s a&nbsp;recognised and often savvy career move. Just as
              people have become more excited and willing to risk joining
              relatively untested companies, founders’ and investors’ mindsets
              have shifted too. <span class="push-single"></span>​<span

              Having an exceptionally talented and motivated team is widely
              recognised as the surest way to unlocking not just unicorn, but
              decacorn, and higher, valuations. For example, Revolut (<span
                class="caps"
                >UK</span
              >) is now reported to be valued at $<span class="numbers"
                >33</span
              >
              billion. Sharing some additional percentage points of equity is
              a&nbsp;small price to pay in pursuit of such riches. Government
              and tax policy across Europe, while still fragmented, is also
              slowly adapting to encourage the use of employee ownership, thanks
              in part to campaigns such as the Index-backed
              <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
                ><u>Not Optional</u></a
              >. Six European nations now have more startup-friendly stock
              options policies than the <span class="caps">US</span> itself.
            </p>

            <p dir="ltr">
              But there’s still a&nbsp;way to go. European option pools are
              still smaller on average than in the
              <span class="caps">US</span> by around
              <span class="numbers">3</span>%, and the actual value of these
              grants is also reduced by the lower average valuations of European
              startups. We must maintain momentum.

            <p dir="ltr">
              If you’re a&nbsp;founder, it’s important to keep upsizing your
              option pool as your company grows and you raise money – especially
              in deep tech, where talent is especially competitive. (Index

              In our long experience at Index, we’ve also seen that awarding
              options to every one of your first
              <span class="numbers">200</span> employees (if not more) fosters
              a&nbsp;culture of inclusion and alignment that is critical to
              a&nbsp;startup’s success.

            <p dir="ltr">
              If you’re a&nbsp;policymaker, reforms are still sorely needed
              across Europe to make it easier for startups to deploy equity to
              make themselves more attractive for employees. Many countries
              still treat stock options as income, when it would be much fairer
              to classify them as capital gains, given that they remain illiquid
              for many years and frequently end up worth nothing. And tax would
              best be levied at the point shares are actually sold, not when the
              options are exercised or granted. After all, at that point, the
              recipient may not see any upside for years to come. The Startup
              Nations Standard, launched by the European Commission in March, is
              a&nbsp;great starting point for convincing more national
              governments to make changes such as these a&nbsp;priority.
              Following positive reforms in Latvia, Lithuania, and France,
              several other European governments, including the
              <span class="caps">UK</span>, are actively exploring changes.
            </p>

            <p dir="ltr">
              A fresh approach to employee ownership is crucial if we want
              founders like Nasira to be able to create European tech giants on
              the scale of Google or Amazon. Until then, too much of Europe’s
              top talent will simply flow into the European arms of
              <span class="caps">US</span> firms, relocate overseas, or stick to
              lower-risk corporate jobs. We can’t afford to wait. It’s time for
              workers, founders and investors of the world to unite, embracing
              employee ownership to help build a&nbsp;brighter future.
